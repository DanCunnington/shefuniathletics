<h4 class="montserrat gold">Background</h4>

<p>
	The University of Sheffield Athletics and Cross Country Club competed in the very first university track and field championships (for men) in 1919. Initially, the club was a member of the Inter-Varsity Athletics Board of England and Wales from 1919 which was renamed the Universities Athletics Union (UAU) from 1930 and we also became a member of the British Universities Sports Federation (BUSF) from 1962 (when it was formed). Additionally, women had their own sporting body (Womenâ€™s Inter-Varsity Board WIVAB) from 1923 until the late 1970's, when they joined the UAU. Due to the club's membership with multiple sporting bodies, it meant a busy race schedule with 2 national track championships per year and multiple cross country championships being held in the same race. The club wore white as the main vest colour from 1919 to 1923, changing to white with blue, black and gold trim in 1924. Since then the club has worn either gold, black or a mixture of both as the main vest.
