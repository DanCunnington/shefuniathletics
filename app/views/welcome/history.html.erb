<h4 class="montserrat gold">Background</h4>

<p>
	The University of Sheffield Athletics and Cross Country Club was formed around 1919. Initially, the club was a member of the Universities Athletics Union (UAU) and the British Universities Sports Federation (BUSF). Additionally, women had their own sporting body from around 1923 until the late 1970's, when they joined the UAU. Due to the club's membership with multiple sporting bodies, it meant a busy race schedule with 2 national track championships per year and multiple cross country championships being held in the same race. The club wore white as the main vest colour from 1919 to 1923, changing to white with blue black and gold in 1924.
