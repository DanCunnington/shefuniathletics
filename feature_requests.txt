TO-DO
--------------------------------------------

- Extend CMS to full site
	#DONE Membership Page
	#DONE Coaches
	#DONE Kit
	#DONE Club History
	#DONE Beginners Run Group
	#DONE Where is training
	#DONE Club Records Events
	#DONE Club Records Page - text stuff - cross country/road records
	#DONE Background Image
	* Sponsors - need image and link maybe just remove these completely? Ask
	* Youtube Video
	* All pictures
	- Tidy all of this up
	
- Gmail oauth instead of storing password in environment variables
- Make text more readable - improve contrast/change colours. History page is good. Do it for membership page etc
- Upload all old pictures
- weird error with new_athletes route on sigining up to the newsletter, have a look at old git commits on the routes
- Make any paragraph styles on content inline so they can be picked up by the wysiwyg


---------------------------------------------
DONE
---------------------------------------------
- Record of recent race results
- Rec run routes
- Calendar for upcoming races/events/socials
- Follow/Like buttons next to newsletter sign up buttons
- Finish kit page - maybe link each item displayed to item page
- Output list of all new athletes that have signed up
- Callums Bio
- Validate rec run link
- Look at removing facebook link to log in. Or implement split times
- Fill in beginners run group page
- Fill in membership page
- Get Rachael, Simon and Ant to add in socials and fixtures
- SMTP settings in environment variables, have to edit it on heroku.
- (e.g. committee page - look at cloudinary to 	 allow admin to upload images)
- Think of a better solution for loading the current value of the wysiwyg in instead of using a delay
- Add some method of sorting records. If you add a new one it just goes straight to the bottom
- Add dynamic date to footer
- allow shef.ac.uk email addresses or just normal emails
- Add Sammy as Admin.
- delete image from cloudinary when record is deleted
- delete all new athletes
- Can now choose images from cloudinary
- Allow admins to view and delete other admins (not super admin)
- Cancel Hosting
- Wysiwig doesn't work on firefox - works on i.e and safari
---------------------------------------------
BLOCKS
---------------------------------------------
- Vinco Sport integration - Matt won't let us embed videos directly, but they are publically available on YouTube to  embed anyway. Potenially showcase a few
- Training Split Times
